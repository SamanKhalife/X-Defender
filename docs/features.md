## Features

## X-Defender Features

### 1. **High-Performance DDoS Mitigation**
   - **Ultra-Low-Latency Processing:** Utilizes eBPF and XDP for packet filtering and mitigation at the network interface level, achieving extremely low latency and high throughput.
   - **Direct Network Interface Handling:** Processes packets directly within the kernel, reducing the need for user-space interactions and improving efficiency.

### 2. **Real-Time Rate Limiting**
   - **Dynamic Traffic Management:** Implements real-time rate limiting to control traffic flows and prevent network congestion or resource exhaustion.
   - **Optimized Performance:** Balances traffic control with the need to maintain performance for legitimate users, ensuring smooth network operations.

### 4. **Customizable Policies**
   - **Flexible Rule Configuration:** Allows users to define and adjust rate-limiting and traffic redirection rules based on specific requirements or evolving attack patterns.
   - **Adaptable Protection:** Provides the ability to tailor security policies to address various attack scenarios and network conditions.

### 5. **IPv4 and IPv6 Support**
   - **Comprehensive Protocol Coverage:** Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, ensuring protection across all network layers and adapting to diverse networking environments.
   - **Unified Handling:** Manages traffic for both IP versions seamlessly, avoiding compatibility issues and providing consistent security measures.

### 6. **Low Latency**
   - **Kernel-Level Processing:** Handles packet processing and mitigation within the kernel space to minimize latency and overhead.
   - **Efficient Packet Handling:** Ensures that packet processing is performed with minimal delay, contributing to overall network efficiency and performance.
